	<p>Hi, I'm Adrianna.</p>
<p>You may know me from my main blog, <a href="https://popagandhi.com">Popagandhi</a>, or from <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@skinnylatte">Mastodon</a>. (Previously, I was better known as @skinnylatte on the bird site too.)</p>
<p>The main site at <a href="https://popagandhi.com">Popagandhi </a> is my long form blog with essays and posts about tech, life, the world. This space here is an experiment in documenting a 2022-2023 attempt to get back into creative things.</p>
<p>In the early 00s and 10s I had the amazing opportunity to have traveled the world working on creative projects. Alongside my software career, I was always in the nosy business of assisting photojournalists and writers, translating for them, taking them to interesting places around Southeast and South Asia, which I call home. Sometimes I also got published as a writer or photographer. I was most interested in the cultural and food stories of the following countries.</p>

<p>Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia, India, Bangladesh and elsewhere were my spots; places I knew intimately. Sometime in the mid 10s, I had a terrible burn out from health and other issues and I completely stopped working in this area, focusing only on software.</p>
<p>The nice thing about this sort of work is that you can pick up where you left off. Now, I am in San Francisco. It's a different type of excitement from my previous life. But I am motivated to tell stories again: with my words, pictures, videos.</p>
<p>I don't know where this is going to go, but I think it will be fun.</p>
