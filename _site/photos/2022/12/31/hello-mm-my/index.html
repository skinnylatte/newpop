	<h2>Hello 35mm my old friend</h2>
</p>
	<p>I have always loved film photography. I love everything about it.</p>
<p>From the moment I was given a disposable film camera as a child, to collecting old cameras and taking them on my travels, I love the whole process of waiting to see what photos I come back with.</p>
<p>Like so many others, I have been mostly digital for a while. That's fine. I don't much care for the film vs digital debate; but I <em>love</em> film cameras, the older the better.</p>
<p>At the end of 2022, I decided to jump back into film again. I now live somewhere else (San Francisco), have more time and ability to indulge this admittedly expensive and indulgent hobby, and also generally feel like I have more stories I'd like to share.</p>
<p>Before I do that, I'd like to start at the beginning.</p>
<p>17 years ago: this was me in a different place and time. With the same old hobby. Let's see what it all looks like when I pick up where I last left off, shall we?</p>
