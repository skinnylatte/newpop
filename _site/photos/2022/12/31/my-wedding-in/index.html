	<h2>My wedding in film and digital</h2>
</p>
	<p>My friend <a href="http://javad-ti.com/category/essays/">Javad Tizmaghz</a>, an excellent photographer and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jiawoodwoodworking4285">even better woodworker</a>, took our photos for our wedding.</p>
<p>It's important to note that queer marriage is not recognized in our home countries.</p>
<p>We took these photos, and then we went to Auckland, New Zealand, for the actual ceremony.</p>
<p>It was only fitting that these photos were taken in the woods near Bukit Timah, where the old railway line connected both of our cities. It was also a place of refuge and safety for me, as I frequently went there as a child to walk and spend time in nature. Even today, when I go home, I still try to go to that area frequently.</p>
<p>Which one looks like film and which one looks digital?</p>
