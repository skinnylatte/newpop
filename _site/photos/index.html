		<div><p>Whenever I can, I make the 45 minute walk to Chinatown in San Francisco to Dim Sum Bistro, my favorite 'cheap dimsum' spot. Sometimes, I take photos too.</p>
<p>I say this every chance I get: dimsum isn't always 'cheap' food. Dimsum can be fancy, and should be fancy, because to make large amounts of high quality dimsum you need a very large team. 'Nice dimsum' is a treat. It's a birthday meal, it's a treat you give your parents, it's going out to linger over nice tea and good ingredients to snack on dishes you probably won't make at home.</p>
<p>Cheap dimsum also has a place. But it should still be fresh and of relatively high quality. The menu should be large and the 'skin' of dumplings shouldn't be too thick. On these metrics, many of the other Chinatown dimsum places don't pass muster for me. But Dim Sum Bistro always delivers. So I'm glad it's here, and I'm glad I can have good, cheap dimsum.</p>

	      <h3><a href="/photos/2023/12/10/surabaya-by-ojek/">Surabaya by Ojek</a> | December 10, 2023</h3>
		<div><p>My oldest friend in the world lives in Surabaya, Indonesia. I try to see her as much as possible. Now that I live ten thousand miles away, it's a little harder, but if I'm back in Singapore I try to head that way: it's easy and cheap to get there from Singapore.</p>
<p>Surabaya will always have a soft spot in my heart. Not only is it home to my favorite Indonesian cuisines (East Javanese and Madura food are the best), it's also a chill little city. I know enough people and I've spent so much time there, I have a bucket list of things to do every time I go. Instead of going to Surabaya five times a year like I used to, back when I lived in this part of the world, I'll be lucky to get there five times in this decade. Which makes me sad.</p>
<p>So I made the most of my trip in September. When my friend was at work, I traipsed around the city the only way I know how: at the back of a motorbike taxi, called an <em>ojek</em>.</p>
<p>I wanted to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/RhrUYdJ9iDa21RnG6">get to a wet market</a> just before my flight to Singapore. I had noodles to eat, and spices to bring back with me. I also managed to buy a few blocks of deliciously fresh <em>tempeh</em> that Indonesian friends in Singapore said was some of the best tempeh <em>they'd</em> ever had. Because Surabaya has the best food!</p>
<p>Here are some photos from the back of a bike, and from a market.</p>

<p><em>'Pak sy sdh sampe Pintu Day ya. bpk di mn?' (&quot;I'm at the pickup point, door D. Where are you?&quot; Text messages to ojek drivers)</em></p>

<p><em>The halal food in Indonesia is delicious of course, but the not-halal food in Indonesian cities with a large Chinese community like Surabaya, Medan, etc is also top tier. I went there to get me some noodles from <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/A3KrAcquo3VTHpR37">Mie Cong Sim</a>.</em></p>
