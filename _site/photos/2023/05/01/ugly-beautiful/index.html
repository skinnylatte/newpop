	<h2>Ugly / Beautiful</h2>
</p>
	<p>Last Friday, I had the unfortunate honor of experiencing (yet another) <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@skinnylatte/110279582306828894">race-related incident in San Francisco</a>. A mentally unwell person pointed a kitchen blow torch at me, with the flame out, and threatened to 'burn me' because I was an 'ugly Chinese ho'. I laughed it off, but I guess she was serious, and then she started pointing that thing at my dog and also calling her an ugly Chinese ho (???). Thankfully, I was able to leave as my bus arrived quickly.</p>
<p>I took the day off to decompress. This situation came hot on the heels of some conversations that my wife and I have been having: what is home? Where is it? What does it mean for us to build a home together?  I decided to take a long walk through San Francisco. I needed to remember why I came here, and why this city is still,  despite its many, many warts, a home I see us living in for the long haul.</p>
<p>I got coffee, met friends and family for dim sum, pet many dogs. I looked at the bay; I breathed in and out. While the city's beauty cannot make up for some of the ugliness that one experiences as a result of bigotry, I am reminded of how, on balance, I have had a largely good time here; I have experienced a lot of love and support, especially at moments like these; and I have the space to participate in activism to push back precisely on this sort of thing.</p>

<p>Saw many gorgeous dogs on a gorgeous day.</p>

<p>And many relevant signs.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I come back to my maybe slightly nihilistic view <a href="https://popagandhi.com/2022-11-america/">that there are no good countries</a>. My wife experiences everyday racism in Singapore, that felt like it was worsening towards the end of her decade there; that, plus the fact that my home country doesn't recognize our marriage, are among the many reasons we don't live there anymore. A country where we are both outsiders, where we have the ability to participate fully in the building of a society that we want to be a part of, feels, at this point, like where we want to be <em>in spite of</em> the other BS that it comes with.</p>
