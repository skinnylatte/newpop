	<h2>Manga review: Moyasimon volume 1</h2>
</p>
	<p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780345514721">Moyasimon</a> by Masayuki Ishikawa ðŸ“š</p>
<p>I spent the latter half of 2022 reading widely on all things microbiome and mycology. I am fascinated by these two related topics, particularly by how little we seem to know about it. I certainly wish I had been exposed to these topics more extensively in school.</p>
<p>From a book about mushrooms, I was introduced to a manga about a boy who can see germs and bacteria. It's certainly a topic I never imagined I would read about in this format. It's very educational but also fun.</p>
<p>It's set in an agriculture university, and through a variety of characters tells you about the different types of bacteria in sake-brewing, bacteria that exists around us, as well as different fermentation practices around the world. It's fun, and quite action-packed for manga that's about something so.. unseen. Highly recommended, and I'm digging into volume 2 as we speak.</p>
