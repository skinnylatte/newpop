	<h2>Graphic novel review: All Quiet in Vikaspuri</h2>
</p>
	<p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9789351775744">All Quiet in Vikaspuri</a> by Sarnath Banerjee ðŸ“š</p>
<p>Sarnath Banerjee's graphic novel &quot;All Quiet in Vikaspuri&quot; is an alt universe / dystopian future story centered on the posh neighborhood of Vikaspuri in South Delhi. An ensemble of colorful characters illuminate this otherwise monochrome book, whose pencil art is sparse, but powerful.</p>
<p>Girish, a psychic plumber tasked with finding the magical river Saraswati. A former army colonel. A former employee of the Delhi Water Board.</p>
<p>For anyone who is vaguely interested in how Asia's mega-cities balance urban planning, growth and ecology (hint: mostly poorly), this is a poignant way to understand some of the issues at stake. Even though the characters and issues are presented as dystopian fantasy, they are very real.</p>
<p>Nowhere more real than Banerjee's quips about Gurgaon, the satellite city just outside New Delhi that was built by private enterprise, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/04/gurgaon-life-city-built-private-companies-india-intel-google">feels like it</a>.</p>
<p>In the graphic novel, he says, &quot;80 per cent of Indian cities will become like Gurgaon&quot;. &quot;People think their building provides their water and power.&quot;</p>
