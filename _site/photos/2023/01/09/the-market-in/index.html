	<h2>The Market in Mae Salong</h2>
</p>
	<p>Mae Salong is one of the most interesting little towns I've ever been to. It is said that many of the town's folks are descended from the southern Kuomintang army during the Chinese civil war. They went south through to Thailand with instructions to wait there in case Generalissimo Chiang wanted to mount a southern attack against the Communists. That day never came.</p>
<p>My mother and I went to spend a week here together once (she also likes adventurous and historical vacations), and I wound up meeting so many people because she's so good at talking to people. She speaks many languages, including the several languages spoken by this community.</p>
<p>We went to the market every day for fresh soy milk and <em>you tiao</em>. It's a memory I will cherish, and I think I have my mum to thank for why I am really interested in people, adventure, food and stories.</p>
