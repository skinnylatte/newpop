	<h2>Half Frames Around The Tenderloin</h2>
</p>
	<p>The Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco frequently gets a bad rep, but I could not live anywhere else in this city. I live on a block where I get to speak my first language, the Teochew / Chiu Chow dialect of Chaoshan, with all of the Southeast Asian Chinese people here who own restaurants, grocery stores, and who mostly settled here after the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>Being in community and surrounded by the intimacy of language and culture has given me a different perspective on this part of town.</p>
<p>My photographs will often reflect this, and here I really like these half frame photos I took around here with my Kodak H35 toy camera.</p>
