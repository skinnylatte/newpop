	<h2>Well Fed: Two Artisans</h2>
</p>
	<p>As you may know from elsewhere, I <em>love</em> food. I am obsessed with it. I love eating, I love food stories, I love writing about food, I love writing about people who make and eat food.</p>
<p>I did that more actively in the past where I wrote a few travel guidebooks and cookbooks, and also published a few articles about Asian food culture and chefs in various publications around the world.</p>
<p>From my archives, photos of two true artisans. One in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the other in Roses, in Spain's Costa Brava coastal region.</p>

<caption><em>I maintain that you haven't had satay / sate until you've been to Malaysia, Indonesia or Thailand. The quality and artistry of this type of grilled skewer is on a whole other level. Xinjiang style BBQ skewers are also very good, but in the realm of well spiced, fatty satay Nusantara style, this is my favorite. Unmarinated and unseasoned chicken breast satay in Asian restaurants in America make me weep.</em></caption>

<caption><em>I had the opportunity to eat at the 'best restaurant in the world' (El Bulli) in 2008, shortly before they closed. It was a memorable meal, but the ridiculously great seafood at Rafa's in the town of Roses was even better. Here, Rafa himself weighing the seafood he's about to feed the hungry patrons of his tiny restaurant</em></caption>
<p><strong>Photos shot on Canon 350D and 50D, with a 17-40L lens, probably one of my all time favorite lenses.</strong></p>
