	<h2>Touching Grass: Taroko Gorge, Taiwan</h2>
</p>
	<p>Taiwan's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taroko_National_Park">Taroko Gorge</a> near Hualien is a place of great beauty.</p>
<p>I spent a fun day here in 2006 with my family, with my Leica M3 and some black and white film (I am guessing it is Tri-X 400, which would have been what I was using a lot back then).</p>
<p>I don't photograph nature or landscapes very much, so am very out of my depth here, but I do like the way these photos turned out. Taiwan is a place of great natural beauty, and I don't feel like I've seen enough of it even though I've been many times. (I haven't had enough of the food either, which is in my opinion one of the best in the world.)</p>
<p>In 2023, I am far more into being outdoors in nature than I was at the time. I will take more photos of the Californian outdoors shortly.</p>
