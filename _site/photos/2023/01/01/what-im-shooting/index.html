<caption><em>Nikon point and shoot camera has wide and tele lenses, so it’s very handy. Not quite as slim as an Olympus XA, though.</em></caption>
<p>I got a <a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Nikon_L35TWAF/L35TWAD/Tele%E2%80%A2Touch">Nikon L35TWAD</a> some time ago but was not able to turn it on. Turns out these babies have a rather iffy battery door. I finally fixed it, and have loaded in my first roll of film. I’m excited to see how the photos turn out.</p>
<p>There are a few versions of the L35 camera, they’re all quite capable.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/1dHtd82prxQ">Check out what this camera can do.</a> There is a lot more info on YouTube about this camera now than when I first got it. I’m interested in the AWAF weather-sealed version that has a better battery door, but the eBay prices are quite high at the moment.</p>
