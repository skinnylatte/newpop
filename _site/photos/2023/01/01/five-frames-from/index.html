	<h2>Five Frames from Ceylon</h2>
</p>
	<p>Between 2013 and 2016, I went to Colombo quite frequently for work and relaxation. An old friend of mine from school lived there, and it was such an easy flight from Singapore that I found every excuse to go there, really. The scuba diving is phenomenal, too.</p>
<p>This past year, Sri Lanka has been in my thoughts. The troubled island continues to have a difficult time economically and politically. I highly recommend my friend Rohini Mohan's book, <a href="http://www.rohinimohan.in">The Seasons of Trouble</a>, for a gripping read of the civil war era.</p>
<p>It's a beautiful country, and I hope to return some day.</p>
<p>I don't remember what camera I used here, <s>but it's quite likely.. an iPhone 5S</s> definitely a Sony Nex-5 with 16mm lens!</p>
