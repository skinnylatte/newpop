	<h2>Roadtrips and Chicken Rice Balls</h2>
</p>
	<p>In my last year of university I started dating a person who lived 250 miles away from me. It was my first serious relationship, and my last long(ish) distance one.</p>
<p>Before we found a living arrangement (that involved me moving to her city), we met sometimes in the middle. Luckily, her country was full of fun towns and cities with <a href="https://www.sgmytaxi.com/chicken-rice-balls-melaka/">delicious food</a>, so I didn't mind.</p>
<p>That relationship eventually fizzled out after several years, but I got from it: Cookie, a deep love for that country, and many years of happy food and travel memories.</p>
