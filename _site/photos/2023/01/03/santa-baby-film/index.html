	<h2>Santa Baby (Film Version)</h2>
</p>
	<p>Happy holidays! We're having weather here in San Francisco, which is a bit of an event. My plan for the next couple of weeks is to stay inside. This city is not made for weather, since we so rarely have any.</p>
<p>The best thing that happened to me over Christmas 2022 is that I started shooting film again.</p>
<p>Funny story: I was so mad at how my last few rolls of film turned out that I stopped using my film cameras for a few years. Turns out I have poor eyesight in my right eye, and I can't really focus rangefinders very well. I'm getting that fixed. So thank you, rangefinder focus, for letting me know to check my eyesight.</p>
<p>Some Santa-related photos from the last couple of weeks. I think this was Kodacolor 200, but I can never remember.</p>
