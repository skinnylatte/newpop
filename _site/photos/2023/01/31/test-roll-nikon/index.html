	<h2>Test roll: Nikon L35TWAD</h2>
</p>
	<p>As I <a href="https://micro.popagandhi.com/2023/01/01/what-im-shooting.html">previously mentioned</a>, I've had my Nikon L35TWAD for some time but was not able to turn it on until now. I'm glad I managed to do that, because it's been such a joy to use! The idea that you can have two very good lenses: a wide and a telephoto one, in such a tiny package, is wonderful to me.</p>
<p>Here's a test shot at dusk with Fuji Superia 400 film, handheld: I like it a lot. I'm going to take it out for a few more rolls.</p>
