	<h2>Five Frames in Beirut</h2>
</p>
	<p>Beirut's Gemmayzeh is one of the most popular neighborhoods for nightlife. It's full of bars and galleries and when I am in town, I do tend to be there quite regularly. The <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/i9AabLoqRaKHberj8">Torino Express</a> is one of my favorite cafes in the world. I don't have much opportunity to go there anymore, which saddens me. A lot has changed since I was there last, half a decade ago.</p>
