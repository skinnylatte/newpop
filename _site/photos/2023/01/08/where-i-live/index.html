	<h2>Where I Live Now: Near San Francisco&#39;s Mission District</h2>
</p>
	<p>In 2018, my wife and I moved to San Francisco. We love the Mission district and try to spend as much time there as we can, especially for groceries and tacos. (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/AKTHmUJMprtfPcAp7">La Oaxaque√±a</a> is our favorite.)</p>
<p>I'm especially interested in the less gentrified bits of it that remain. A few steps away from Valencia Street, there are still pockets of the Mission that are gritty and edgy. Those are the parts of the Mission that tend to have the food and groceries that I want to have.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I admire the old department store signs for shops long gone, in buildings still vacant and abandoned. I like grit, real people, and greasy tacos. I like these parts of the Mission.</p>
