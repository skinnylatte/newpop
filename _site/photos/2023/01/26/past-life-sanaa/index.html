	<h2>Past Life: Sana&#39;a Street Life</h2>
</p>
	<p>Getting to see Sana'a in 2009 was an honor. It was one of my favorite cities: ever. Anywhere. I stayed with a friend and I got to wander around sometimes with him and his family, but sometimes alone. It was the weight of history and the air of what was about to happen: I frequently described Yemen as 'better than a set from the Passion of Christ'. It felt old, dusty, but also warm and familiar.</p>
<p>At the time, I made some videos of my trip. You can see me talk about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkGKPagtzEs&amp;t=112s">spending time with some local aunties</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACjIDnX8rPo">how they fed me</a>. I also have a stack of photos from that trip that I never looked at. What's happening in that country is truly horrid and makes me feel sick to my stomach. (My friend managed to leave, but his family remains in Sana'a.)</p>
<p>You hear about the hospitality of that part of the world but you never truly understand it until you've been a guest. Then it's a memory that you'll never lose.</p>
