	<h2>Street Life: Air Mata Kucing</h2>
</p>
	<p>As a child, my parents would put us on a bus or train to Kuala Lumpur to see friends, visit people, or just have a weekend break.</p>
<p>One of my strongest memories of KL: getting out of the overnight train at the old railway station, and strolling to Chinatown (Petaling Street) for breakfast. <em>Air mata kucing</em> (literally translated to 'cat eye water'), is a sweet drink with ice, rock sugar and longans. This stall in Petaling St is extremely famous, and probably still there today. I loved drinking it out of the little steel bowls they used to have, the ice cooling me down in the ever present Malaysian heat.</p>
<p>This photograph was probably taken in 2005 with a Yashica Electro 35. I can't wait to go back there and have it again.</p>

<caption><em>Longans are now popular in the west as a sugar alternative: 'monkfruit' sweetener is popular with fitness types. I like the fruity fleshy taste of longan, or 'luo han guo', in a traditionally made beverage like this. To this day, I haven't found a better version than this stall, though nostalgia is a drug.</em></caption>
