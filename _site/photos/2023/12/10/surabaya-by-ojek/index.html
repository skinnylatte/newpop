	<p>My oldest friend in the world lives in Surabaya, Indonesia. I try to see her as much as possible. Now that I live ten thousand miles away, it's a little harder, but if I'm back in Singapore I try to head that way: it's easy and cheap to get there from Singapore.</p>
<p>Surabaya will always have a soft spot in my heart. Not only is it home to my favorite Indonesian cuisines (East Javanese and Madura food are the best), it's also a chill little city. I know enough people and I've spent so much time there, I have a bucket list of things to do every time I go. Instead of going to Surabaya five times a year like I used to, back when I lived in this part of the world, I'll be lucky to get there five times in this decade. Which makes me sad.</p>
<p>So I made the most of my trip in September. When my friend was at work, I traipsed around the city the only way I know how: at the back of a motorbike taxi, called an <em>ojek</em>.</p>
<p>I wanted to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/RhrUYdJ9iDa21RnG6">get to a wet market</a> just before my flight to Singapore. I had noodles to eat, and spices to bring back with me. I also managed to buy a few blocks of deliciously fresh <em>tempeh</em> that Indonesian friends in Singapore said was some of the best tempeh <em>they'd</em> ever had. Because Surabaya has the best food!</p>
<p>Here are some photos from the back of a bike, and from a market.</p>

<p><em>'Pak sy sdh sampe Pintu Day ya. bpk di mn?' (&quot;I'm at the pickup point, door D. Where are you?&quot; Text messages to ojek drivers)</em></p>

<p><em>The halal food in Indonesia is delicious of course, but the not-halal food in Indonesian cities with a large Chinese community like Surabaya, Medan, etc is also top tier. I went there to get me some noodles from <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/A3KrAcquo3VTHpR37">Mie Cong Sim</a>.</em></p>
