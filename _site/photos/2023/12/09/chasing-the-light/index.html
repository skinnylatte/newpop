	<h2>Chasing the Light </h2>
</p>
	<p>As a person from the literal equator, I struggle a lot with winter. Not the cold, since it's not really that cold here in northern California, but with the increasingly shorter days. The best way I can describe it is that I feel as though my brain, happiness, and overall health is powered by the sun. The sun is my battery. The less of it there is, the worse I feel. Every year, without fail.</p>
<p>Going out for a run or walk daily has been the only thing that's worked to help me feel <em>okay</em> consistently. Even when it's grey and gloomy and rainy (the extent of winter here in San Francisco, but already way too awful for me), I try to go out for a run. I carry a tiny Olympus XA2 in my pocket and I take photos of the things that I see.</p>
<p>I see many beautiful things, because San Francisco is beautiful, and being outside in the beauty restores me.</p>
