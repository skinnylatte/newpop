	<h2>Birds at Sea</h2>
</p>
	<p>Once or twice a year, I try to go on a boat ride with some birders. I started birding as a joke (&quot;I'm getting old I need an old person hobby!&quot;) but found that I love it.  I especially love pelagic birds (and also shore birds, but to a lesser extent). Something about the raw power of the ocean and the ocean life in and around and above it really inspires me. The first time I went, I saw a feeding frenzy up close: of whales hunting, pushing fish up to the surface, different types of birds diving in and out of the water. It was majestic.</p>
<p>The Farallon Islands don't look too far from San Francisco on the map but it's many hours in treacherous waters. Many people throw up: for hours. I have never had motion sickness, so I was happy to tap on that life skill to try to take photos from the boat. It's hard when you're on a boat, harder when the waters are so incredibly choppy.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are some photos I loved from the trip back in July.</p>
