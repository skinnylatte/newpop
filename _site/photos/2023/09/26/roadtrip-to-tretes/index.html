	<h2>Roadtrip to Tretes</h2>
</p>
	<p>A memory I will always treasure: the opportunities I've had to visit Tretes. Going to Tretes always means going on a short road trip with my best friend of 25 years. I remember listening to her describe her home to me, when we met as teenagers in Singapore, and dreaming about going there with her one day.</p>
<p>Indeed, we stayed friends, and I've visited. Many times. While I live ten thousand miles away now, Indonesia, especially East Java, will always have a special place in my heart.</p>
<p>This past weekend, we managed to get up to Tretes again. The trip was remarkably the same as every other time. Consistently delightful food and company. I am going to miss this. And everyone.</p>

<p>Absolutely delightful rawon, pecel and empal. Possibly one of my favorite restaurants in the world.</p>

<p>Sunlight trickling into the restaurant we usually stop at.</p>

<p>I don't know anyone who eats as much <em>krupuk</em> as I do. And it's the best in this part of the world.</p>

<p>Nasi rawon is my favorite dish in Indonesian cuisine. I can eat it a few times a day, every day. That I don't get (good versions of) it, or at all, abroad, is why I feel the need to really focus on my rawon time when I am in East Java.</p>

<p>Check out the view. You can't hear it, but there was also beautiful traditional / classical Javanese music streaming out of a school or home in the valley below. Culturally, this part of the world just speaks to my soul.</p>
