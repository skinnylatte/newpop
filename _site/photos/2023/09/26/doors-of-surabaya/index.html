	<h2>Doors of Surabaya</h2>
</p>
	<p>One of my oldest friends in the world lives in Surabaya. I love visiting her. Not only is the food one of my favorite cuisines (East Java food is my favorite Indonesian regional food, and it can be hard to get abroad), the city is also a place I enjoy photographing. Eat, shoot, eat, shoot. That's basically all I do there.</p>
<p>This was my first time there with a film camera. I brought my trusty tiny Nikon FE with a 28mm f.28 lens, as well as a 50mm pancake f1.8 lens. That's really all I need on a vacation.</p>
<p>I even got the film sent off and developed at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/impossible_lab/">a local lab</a> in Surabaya, which I was happy with.</p>

<p>I'm getting into the swing of things, shooting and developing film locally. Although I miss developing film since I'm so used to it, it's nice to see what services are available.</p>
