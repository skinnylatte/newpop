	<h2>My month so far</h2>
</p>
	<p>A series of unprecedented storms swept us in San Francisco in January and February. Dark clouds and gloomy skies are not your typical fare here. I felt just as gloomy, but also thankful for the rain's impact on California's drought situation.</p>

<p>Soon, the sky started becoming bluer and bluer. Sometimes pink too.</p>

<p>And now we're back to blue, and I'm happy again.</p>
