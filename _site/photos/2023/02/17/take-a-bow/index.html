<p><em>Photo taken on Leica M3, 50mm Summilux, Kodak T-Max P3200, developed and scanned by Underdog Film Lab, Oakland.</em></p>
<p>One of the joys of living in downtown San Francisco is how I can get to many cultural events with a 10 minute walk. Some nights it's jazz at SFJazz, others it's at the opera or symphony. Many rock and punk (even <a href="https://wl.seetickets.us/event/KAFANA-BALKAN/527965?afflky=RickshawStop">Balkan music</a>!) shows within walking or transit distance, too! Even though many artists have been priced out of San Francisco, many cornerstone and higher prestige shows still remain here at the downtown venues. I do find myself popping over to Oakland for more hiphop and even folk music, though. That stuff is barely in San Francisco anymore.</p>
<p>I brought my Leica M3 and 50mm Summilux to the SF Symphony to watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Blomstedt">Herbert Blomstedt</a> conduct <a href="https://www.sfsymphony.org/Buy-Tickets/2022-23/Blomstedt-Conducts-Dvorak">Dvořák’s Eighth Symphony</a>. With high ISO film (T-Max P3200) of course. The Leica was very silent, though of course I didn't take photos while the orchestra was playing. It was also my first time shooting T-Max P3200 indoors in a dim setting. I like this photo, and want to keep documenting the music I go to see.</p>
