<p>When you think of bakeries in San Francisco, perhaps you think of sourdough. Certainly, there are some well known bakeries in the city known for their sourdough, but that's not a style or type of bread I enjoy at all.</p>
<p>I don't think it's for everyone, but I like Chinese and Japanese bakeries. I like soft, pillowy breads that straddle the line between savory and sweet. I like hot dogs in my buns. I like ham in my bread. I like scallions in them, too. Barbecue pork. Eggs. All of it. My palate leans heavily on the savory side of things, and I also prefer my breads that way. Salty. Savory. I opine on that, and more, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7BRqpyroBQ&amp;t=4s">in this video</a>.</p>
<p>As part of my increasing frustration at the perennial sour-ness of bread in the city I now live in, I seek out Chinese bakeries. Here are a few of my favorites.</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/hgwP4Wq3j8Tn6CNy7">Mee Mee bakery</a> in Chinatown (pictured), is known for its 'cow ear cookies' or 'pig ear cookies', a savory spiral biscuit that's really more salty than sweet. I love that shit.</p>
<p>I also like <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/6edZvEUcsJAS4pkC8">Yummy Bakery</a> for Hong Kong style 'paper cup cakes', which are fluffier and softer than American cupcakes; almost like a souffle, but like paper. If that makes sense. Also try their egg white tarts and wife cakes.</p>
<p>In the Outer Mission, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/k9DJMAcMoYmUKi4Q6">Princess Bakery</a> is an old school favorite. Try the coconut buns and the hot dog scallion buns. In the same neighborhood, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/yQcFvBsLDoPpL1YZ8">Hong Kong Bakery</a> is a classic. Don't sleep on the Excelsior: I think it has the highest density of my favorite Chinese food in the city, more than Chinatown and more than the Sunset or Richmond.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/fSQsaUxc8FqUQvTJ6">Pineapple King Bakery</a>, like I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7BRqpyroBQ&amp;t=4s">recommend in the YouTube show</a>. Try literally anything there, and definitely don't skip the milk tea. I wish there were more Japanese bakeries in the city, but there are not. I'm glad people enjoy the sourdough of San Francisco, but I'm overjoyed that I have these alternatives here. I'm trying to take the perspective of &quot;it's okay to not like things&quot;, but it is so goddamn hard when it's so hard to find good bread in this city that isn't surprisingly sour. (Recently, I bought a bag of bagels, and it was made of sourdough. Without warning. Sour simply isn't a flavor I enjoy: <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@skinnylatte/109832248412123015">I also feel that way about American hot sauce</a>.)</p>
