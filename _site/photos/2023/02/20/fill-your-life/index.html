<p>Another photo from another concert I walked to from home.</p>
<p>We were invited to attend a <a href="https://www.ncco.org/events/2023-gala">gala concert for the New Century Chamber Orchestra</a>. I'd gone to a show some time ago, really liked it, wrote about it, and met some of the folks involved through that.</p>
<p>It was our first time attending a high society event in San Francisco. There was wonderful music. The multiple Grammy-winning <a href="https://www.sfgirlschorus.org">San Francisco Girls Chorus</a> sang a few select pieces, and we were also treated to the 'dark, velvety' operatic voice of <a href="http://nikolaprintz.com">Nikola Printz</a>.</p>
<p>Since the theme of the evening was 'Out of the Woods', there were also fairies. Naturally. I took a photo of one of them here.</p>
