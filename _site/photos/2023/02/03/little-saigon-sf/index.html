<p>Mention the Tenderloin and a certain type of San Francisco resident will definitely scrunch up their faces. &quot;Homeless people&quot;, &quot;poop&quot;, &quot;crime&quot;; look behind all of those terms and I believe the fear and condescension is &quot;class&quot;.</p>
<p>The Tenderloin is a working class neighborhood with a largely Southeast Asian, trans, Mexican, Arab,  queer, and Black population. It is also home to many of the city's unhoused population. We also need far more toilets. And housing. Problems aside (as a board member of the Tenderlon Community Benefit District, I am working to improve things in this neighborhood!), I live here because it immerses me deeply in my communities. It is Southeast Asian, and queer, at the same time. I am also far more comfortable around working class people than around the types of people who live across Van Ness. It has the food that I want to eat, and the groceries that I need.</p>
<p>The freedom to run downstairs and get the types of tofu, lemongrass, galangal, many rice types, noodle varieties that I use without having to go to a 'special store', or the 'ethnic aisle', is what makes me feel connected. I know that living in a 'nice neighborhod' where my food lives in the ethnic aisle will be extremely alienating. Not to mention inconvenient.</p>
<p>So here I am, and I am always giddy with joy when I get to grab the freshly made tofu, and the nice stalks of lemongrass, from a Cambodian grocer in the Tenderloin. The lady and her son speak my native language, even though we come from different countries. We have the same conversation daily. &quot;What are you cooking today?&quot;</p>
<p>Tofu is often my answer. The answer is always tofu.</p>
