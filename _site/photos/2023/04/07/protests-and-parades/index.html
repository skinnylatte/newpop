	<h2>Protests and Parades</h2>
</p>
	<p>One of the interesting things about living near City Hall is I never know what I'm going to walk into. Some days it's a protest about the declining state of trans rights in this country. Or one by the Burmese or Iranian communities to try to raise awareness of the issues at home.</p>
<p>Other days it's an Irish festival that somehow has large representation from law enforcement. (For more information about the impact of the Irish in San Francisco law enforcement, read <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Season-of-the-Witch-by-David-Talbot-review-3536031.php">Season of the Witch</a>.) I had my <a href="https://micro.popagandhi.com/2023/03/20/st-patricks-day.html">black and white film camera out</a>, but I also had a roll of Kodak Vision 3 500T film in my rangefinder camera that I got processed and scanned much later.</p>
<p>I was interested in the parade and curious to know how it would proceed in the rain; though like many other observers, I kept a distance from it. I <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/24/singapore-smiley-face-activist-in-one-man-protest-charged-with-unlawful-assembly">come from a country where protest isn't allowed</a> (except in a very specific park with strict rules requiring pre-approval), so I am always going to be photographing and gawking at any protests, and parades (which also require pre-approval where I come from), I think, even if I might not agree with all of them.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I'm going to go to a rally for trans rights. It's cool that I can just stroll over to show my support for things like that.</p>

<p><em>San Francisco is the hub of the Irish diaspora in the West Coast. The police force has also been a favored profession for that community.</em></p>

<p><em>I really like the colors on the motion picture film. This photo would not be as interesting on regular color film!</em></p>
