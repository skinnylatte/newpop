	<h2>Saying Goodbye to Fuji Superia 400</h2>
</p>
	<p>Fuji Superia 400 has been my stock color film for a long time. I have 10 rolls left, and when that's gone <a href="https://petapixel.com/2023/04/10/new-fujifilm-400-color-negative-film-probably-replaces-superia-x-tra-400/">it doesn't look like I'll be able to find it easily anymore</a>. It was my favorite 'buy it at a drugstore' film, but now that I can't buy it easily, I don't think I will put in the effort to source it. For color, I will probably switch to Ektar and Kodak Vision 3 250D or 500T. Or some combination of all of that.</p>
<p>Until then, some photos celebrating Fuji Superia 400.</p>
