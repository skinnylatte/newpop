<h2>About me</h2>

<p>Hi, I'm Adrianna.</p>

<p>I've been publishing here since 2003. You might have known me in different iterations: angry young queer, optimistic college student, world traveler, entrepreneur, foodie, athlete, startup person, non-profit founder and now, civic technologist at the world's foremost marine and deep sea institution.</p>

<p>After a lost decade publishing content <em>elsewhere</em> (big tech social media companies), I'm now reinventing my web presence again. Though it feels more like coming home to a familiar feeling: through every version of myself on the Internet, building websites and learning new skills have been the constant.</p>

<p>That's how I make my living, too. In my day job, I lead the product team at <a href="https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/">Monterey Bay Aquarium</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, I was the leader of the product management team at <a href="https://sf.gov"/>San Francisco Digital Services</a>, the digital team for the City and County of San Francisco for 5 years. There, I played <a href="https://govinsider.asia/intl-en/article/a-singaporean-in-san-francisco">a leading role in San Francisco's web services</a>, particularly in Covid-19 information, vaccination, recovery and relief. She is the author of the upcoming book, "<strong>Product for the People</strong>: A Guide to Building Mission-Driven Digital Services in Government and Nonprofit Organizations".</p> 

<p>I also <a href="https://www.humane-intelligence.org/">advise Humane Intelligence</a> on AI red-teaming, and the U.S. General Services Administration <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/acquisition-policy/gsa-acquisition-policy-federal-advisory-committee">on AI procurement, usage and ethics</a>.</p>

<p>In the mornings, nights and evenings: I run, swim, bike, cook, talk and think about food, coffee, tea and the history and politics of all of those things. I toot, take photos, make zines, work on darkroom photo printing, go birding, play saxophone and piano.</p>

<p>Mostly, I am enjoying life in San Francisco and Monterey with my wife, <s><a href="/posts/cookie-the-cavalier/">dog</a></s>, cat and my ridiculous number of hobbies.</p>
