I have a piece in the Valentine's Day issue of Mint, the Indian paper. Read it [here](http://www.livemint.com/articles/2011/02/11195600/SouthEast-Asia--Full-filling.html). I have not written much since [my cover story](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=13080495&l=984af88aff&id=736905264) in Reader's Digest Asia in July 2010, so I'm feeling pretty good about my "comeback". I will be writing more regularly, here, as well as for a handful of publications.
