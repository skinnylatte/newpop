One of the things I love the most is to randomly meet people who become fast friends â€” even better when they run amazing businesses with products that I love.

When I met Vivian in Bangkok last year, I was fascinated to see that she had done something so important to all entrepreneurs (yet that is done so rarely, and rarely well): she built a business to solve a problem she had been facing her entire life.

She struggled with super sensitive skin, and nothing worked; therefore, she created her own skincare line, [Soul Story](http://soulstory.co).

I tried out some samples, and now it's my skincare line of choice. It's truly excellent.

Unfortunately, it's only available for sale in Thailand and Vietnam so far. Vivian is Korean-Canadian, based in Ho Chi Minh City. She's found a niche in selling mid-high end skincare made in Korea, formulated with Korean dermatologists, for the emerging Asian markets.

If you want a chance to try out her products (and I assure you they are fantastic), here's an opportunity to purchase them no matter where you live. For then next 45 days, you can buy Soul Story products off their Indiegogo campaign. Know that you will also be helping out a first time female founder, too.

I hope that in the next couple of years, Vivian's skincare products will be found in every major city in the world. It's *that* good. Try it.

Support her [Indiegogo campaign](#). I know I will!
