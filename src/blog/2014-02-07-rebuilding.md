1. Almost exactly two years ago I was, too, on a flight to India.<br /><br />Only then I did not know exactly how drastic a turn my life would take on when I returned.

2.  More and more of my friends are getting diagnosed with diseases similar to mine. Autoimmune diseases are the new black.<br /><br />Across all of these experiences the one we've all had has been the extreme upheaval in all of our emotional lives.

3. Sometimes I wonder if the person who made those decisions at the time was me, or the severely impaired bodily part that's wreaked havoc in my head and my heart.<br /><br />Even if the conclusions are the same in the end, I would still like to know that I had some control. But I did not.

4. There is nothing I hate more than feeling like my self-determinism, even if it doesn't really exist, has been impinged upon.<br /><br />Even if the other person making decisions for me was just a temporarily damaged version of myself.

5. I've spent almost two years rebuilding my life.<br /><br />I've subjected it to some pretty extreme versions of what it could have been and can be, and now I've chosen the version I like best.<br /><br />I like this one.

6. This one:<br /><br />This one is happy and confident, pushing 30.<br /><br />This one is writing more, and better.<br /><br />This one has had a handful of career highlights and is working harder to create the sorts of situations and opportunities that will define the next decade; it's within grasp.<br /><br />This one has an incredible support system in Singapore, Malaysia, India and all around the world and feels like the luckiest person in the world to experience such love.<br /><br />This one has a loving family. A beautiful dog. A lovely house in a magical part of the city that she loves more and more. A slew of projects taking shape.<br /><br />This one is learning to finish what she's started.

7. I've struggled to articulate what I feel whenever I return to the city I once lived in.<br /><br />It is a living museum of my loves and losses.<br /><br />It is a diptych where one side is the city that I once knew and the other is the one I no longer do.<br /><br />Time has stopped for me in that city. But I am learning to love it again *after*.

8. The city that is a living museum of love and loss merely preserves them so I can learn to love again.<br /><br />The streets I walked in in them will never be the same.<br /><br />Just as it should be possible to hold two opposing positions at once so as to form a better informed opinion, so too should it be possible to hold multiple feelings simultaneously so that we can love better.<br /><br />For now I pick: terrifying, amazing.<br /><br />Life's too short for compromises. I'm too fond of jumping off boats then learning to swim, anyway.
