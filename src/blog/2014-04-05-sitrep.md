description: I got a Battlestar Galactica tattoo.

1. I got a Battlestar Galactica tattoo
2. I'm pretty pleased about that
3. It's one half of the pair of wings and Caprica constellation that Starbuck gets when she marries Anders
4. Within a couple of hours of getting it, a random stranger proposed to me â€” saying she would get *the other side*
5. Which would be romantic, but that would also mean (a) she's a Cylon (b) we'd have a tumultuous relationship (c) she'd better be damn good at Pyramids
6. It's unbelievable that 10 years has passed since I first started to watch this show
7. I don't generally fan-girl anything, but this was special
8. I identify with Starbuck in far too many ways, if you know what I mean
9. It's potentially far more meaningful than anything else I could have gotten
10. After getting this done I do kinda feel like nothing can frak with my qi

I love BSG.
