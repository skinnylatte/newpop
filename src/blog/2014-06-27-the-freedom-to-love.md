Ten years ago the Internet was a different place. Singapore was a different place. While it wasn't exactly the sort of pitchfork-wielding, gay-vilifying environment you would imagine, you certainly did not feel like people *understood*. You felt, at that time, at odds with large swathes of society, as though it would never accept you. Worst of all, you felt doomed to forever be avoiding the marriage question at Chinese New Year. It did not seem like your Asian relations would ever stop asking you intrusive questions about your personal life, when there was none to share because your chosen pronoun would cause you to be thrown out of the house, ostracised, prayed for, or otherwise politely ignored.

This year, the climate cannot be more different. The [hate groups](http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/police-issue-advisory-for/1208972.html) have openly stepped forward to identify themselves. They even have their own colours. Like in the US, and anywhere else this theatre of *cultural war* is being waged, they've chosen to usurp the word, *family*, for themselves. No matter.

Each year the dot gets bigger and bigger. Each year the LGBTQ community gains strength in multitudes; and its allies, even more. Each year I see more and more families; each familiar face is not the girl I last slept with in a club, unlike what *they think*, it is a friend, ally, collaborator, or all around interesting person.

Challenges abound. Hatred reeks. Certain religionists (that's really what they are, and I won't even sully the term _religious_ by associating that with them) desperately hope to roll back the tide. In 20 years I will be happy to never have to hear a squeak from them ever again, for their present struggles against demographic and cultural sea change will seem as bizarre, absurd and archaic as opponents of interracial, inter-religious love a couple of decades ago.

Here are a couple of things I've written in the past decade. My sexuality has been a big and defining part of life; but love itself comes through, above all. Hope to see you at Pink Dot, and say hi if you see me.

P.S. Also, a friend and I are hosting [Rabbithole](https://www.facebook.com/events/282343721944892/?ref=22), a brand new party for queer women who like good drinks and older company. ðŸ™‚ Come by at Life Is Beautiful, 99 Duxton Road, from 10.30PM on 28 June 2014.
