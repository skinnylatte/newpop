1. I've moved to Jakarta to take part in [Ideabox](http://ideabox.co.id) with my startup, [WoBe](http://wobe.io)

2. I'm writing more on [Medium](http://medium.com/@skinnylatte) these days. The blog format is unsatisfactory to me at the moment

3. Over there, I've started two collections which may be interesting to some of you. In [The Java Diaries](https://medium.com/the-java-diaries), I obsessively track my time in Jakarta in the name of learning. In [Myanmar's Second Wind](https://medium.com/myanmars-second-wind/latest), I write about my year in Yangon and the people I've met there, from the tech entrepreneur's point of view

4. Know someone fun or interesting in Jakarta? I would love to meet them

5. What does one do with a blog these days?
