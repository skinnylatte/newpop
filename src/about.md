Hi, I'm Adrianna.

You may know me from my main blog, [Popagandhi](https://popagandhi.com), or from [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@skinnylatte). (Previously, I was better known as @skinnylatte on the bird site too.)

The main site at [Popagandhi ](https://popagandhi.com) is my long form blog with essays and posts about tech, life, the world. This space here is an experiment in documenting a 2022-2023 attempt to get back into creative things.

In the early 00s and 10s I had the amazing opportunity to have traveled the world working on creative projects. Alongside my software career, I was always in the nosy business of assisting photojournalists and writers, translating for them, taking them to interesting places around Southeast and South Asia, which I call home. Sometimes I also got published as a writer or photographer. I was most interested in the cultural and food stories of the following countries.

Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia, India, Bangladesh and elsewhere were my spots; places I knew intimately. Sometime in the mid 10s, I had a terrible burn out from health and other issues and I completely stopped working in this area, focusing only on software.

The nice thing about this sort of work is that you can pick up where you left off. Now, I am in San Francisco. It's a different type of excitement from my previous life. But I am motivated to tell stories again: with my words, pictures, videos.

I don't know where this is going to go, but I think it will be fun.
