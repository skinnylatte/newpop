I love the Mission. Specifically, I love the less gentrified parts of it. There's still so much life and culture; DJs spinning records on the street, bands playing live Latin jazz, record stores where you can explore cumbria, and Indigenous dance groups that perform at the many plazas.

Despite its many problems, the Mission is where I default to for food, adventure and fun. And to just generally feel alive.

I took all of these photos on my iPhone yesterday.

[Universal Bakery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/juK7FmkNGq8Hgam68) has a wonderful torta de carne asada. With a huge block of salty cheese. It's the perfect sandwich for me.

 I love the colors of the Mission.

 Ever since I started shooting medium format on film, I've much preferred square or 1:1 photos. It helps me see the world in a different way.
