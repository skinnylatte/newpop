Between 2013 and 2016, I went to Colombo quite frequently for work and relaxation. An old friend of mine from school lived there, and it was such an easy flight from Singapore that I found every excuse to go there, really. The scuba diving is phenomenal, too.

This past year, Sri Lanka has been in my thoughts. The troubled island continues to have a difficult time economically and politically. I highly recommend my friend Rohini Mohan's book, [The Seasons of Trouble](http://www.rohinimohan.in), for a gripping read of the civil war era. 

It's a beautiful country, and I hope to return some day. 

I don't remember what camera I used here, <s>but it's quite likely.. an iPhone 5S</s> definitely a Sony Nex-5 with 16mm lens!

<p>Old school cool in one of Colombo's many historical department stores.</p>

<p>Friendly faces everywhere.</p>

<p>So many of the cities I love—Colombo, Chennai, Yangon—former British ports, have a very similar vibe in their port areas.</p>

<p>It's always time for tea.</p>

<p>The languid afternoons felt like they went on forever.</p>
