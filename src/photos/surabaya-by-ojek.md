My oldest friend in the world lives in Surabaya, Indonesia. I try to see her as much as possible. Now that I live ten thousand miles away, it's a little harder, but if I'm back in Singapore I try to head that way: it's easy and cheap to get there from Singapore.

Surabaya will always have a soft spot in my heart. Not only is it home to my favorite Indonesian cuisines (East Javanese and Madura food are the best), it's also a chill little city. I know enough people and I've spent so much time there, I have a bucket list of things to do every time I go. Instead of going to Surabaya five times a year like I used to, back when I lived in this part of the world, I'll be lucky to get there five times in this decade. Which makes me sad.

So I made the most of my trip in September. When my friend was at work, I traipsed around the city the only way I know how: at the back of a motorbike taxi, called an *ojek*. 

I wanted to [get to a wet market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RhrUYdJ9iDa21RnG6) just before my flight to Singapore. I had noodles to eat, and spices to bring back with me. I also managed to buy a few blocks of deliciously fresh *tempeh* that Indonesian friends in Singapore said was some of the best tempeh *they'd* ever had. Because Surabaya has the best food!

Here are some photos from the back of a bike, and from a market.

*If you've lived in Indonesia like I have, the first word you'll learn is 'macet': traffic jam.*

*'Pak sy sdh sampe Pintu Day ya. bpk di mn?' ("I'm at the pickup point, door D. Where are you?" Text messages to ojek drivers)*

*Wet markets have such a delicious mix of fresh foods and cooked foods.*

*The halal food in Indonesia is delicious of course, but the not-halal food in Indonesian cities with a large Chinese community like Surabaya, Medan, etc is also top tier. I went there to get me some noodles from [Mie Cong Sim](https://maps.app.goo.gl/A3KrAcquo3VTHpR37).*

*Banyak motor dimana-mana.*
