My friend [Javad Tizmaghz](http://javad-ti.com/category/essays/), an excellent photographer and [even better woodworker](https://www.youtube.com/@jiawoodwoodworking4285), took our photos for our wedding.

It's important to note that queer marriage is not recognized in our home countries.

We took these photos, and then we went to Auckland, New Zealand, for the actual ceremony.

It was only fitting that these photos were taken in the woods near Bukit Timah, where the old railway line connected both of our cities. It was also a place of refuge and safety for me, as I frequently went there as a child to walk and spend time in nature. Even today, when I go home, I still try to go to that area frequently.

Which one looks like film and which one looks digital?

She was telling me a joke.
