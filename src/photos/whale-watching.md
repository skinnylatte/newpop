When I was a teenager and didn't know anything about whales or lesbians, I heard Margaret Cho say 'lesbians love whale watching. they fucking love it.'

I didn't know what any of that was. 

Well, Margaret Cho, you were RIGHT. I fucking love it.

*A whale named Little Dimple and her calf. Who is somehow, sadly, not called Littler Dimple.*

*All dolphins are whales. But not all whales are dolphins.*

*Mola-mola always astound me with their.. strangeness. I love them.*

*In flight pelagic cormorant left before I could ask, can I kelp you?*

We saw ALL of these on a three hour sunset whale watching trip with [Monterey Bay Whale Watch](https://gowhales.com/). It's a company led by marine biologists, and everything is extremely professional. The marine biologists onboard knew all of the beautiful animals by name and sight. I learned so much! I shall commit to trying to go at least once a month (best employee perk for me)!
