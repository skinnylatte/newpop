I had a drag-filled weekend that was full of trans joy. For that, I am grateful.

On Saturday, I went to the [Drag Up, Fight Back march for drag and trans rights](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/san-francisco-drag-up-fight-back-march-17887311.php). Unless you've been living under a rock, trans people are under attack all over the world including in many parts of the US. California is not immune. It would be silly complacency to assume that because we are in San Francisco, things are going to be fine. In fact, a Republican in Riverside, CA, [has just sponsored AB 1314 which would require educators to inform parents if their kids are trans](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-03-15/california-bill-would-require-schools-to-notify-parents-if-child-is-transgender). I hope I don't have to tell you how harmful that will be to trans people, and how that's just the start of more anti-trans legislation wrapped up in the supposed just-asking-questions 'concern' of 'children'. If they truly cared about the children, they would support an environment where all children, including queer and trans children, don't have to live in fear, where they can be who they are without being used as a political prop.

So we march.

*So much joy. Especially compared to the lone, sad, and hateful anti-trans protestor across the street who nobody could hear or care about. He had a Repent or Perish sign! Very stylish. But not as stylish as these folks on the right side of the protest.*
