When I'm back in Singapore it can be easy to fall into old habits: sleeping in till late, staying out late, doing all of those things I used to do. On my recent trips, I'm trying to remind myself that I've been away for so long  my parents aren't getting younger. My parents' daily routine starts with: picking a different hawker centre every morning to eat at. I try to join them, if I can wake up (they leave extremely early). 

Bukit Merah View is one of my mum's favourites. It's relatively low key and quiet, but has some heavy hitters. More importantly, there's a [wanton noodle stall there](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TqtPhn8Ees1jon658) run by one of our distant relatives (my mother's cousin..?). It's very simple, but always tasty. It was even [recommended in Michelin Bib](https://guide.michelin.com/sg/en/singapore-region/singapore/restaurant/yong-chun-wan-ton-noodle).

The nice thing about a hawker centre is that it's usually attached to a wet and dry market. After a leisurely breakfast I was able to wander over to the other side to pick up some essentials: like the [Feng He Yuan first extract dark soy sauce](https://fenghegarden.com/products/first-extract-dark-soy-sauce). None of the dark soy sauces I get in the US compare, and it is absolutely essential for some of the traditional Hokkien and Teochew dishes that I try to cook abroad. 

While I don't relish waking up at 6 in the morning when I'm on vacation, food, and family is worth it: and in this part of the world, food and family is one and the same.

Carrying a retro TLR camera around my neck was fun. Many older people in Singapore looked at it, wide-eyed, and told me that they used to love their Seagull or Yashica cameras too.

My distant relatives' [simple, but very good, wanton noodles](https://guide.michelin.com/sg/en/singapore-region/singapore/restaurant/yong-chun-wan-ton-noodle). If you're expecting KL style lardy savory wanton noodles, you will be disappointed: this is a basic Cantonese Singaporean style plain wanton noodles with bouncy noodles and good, basic ingredients.
