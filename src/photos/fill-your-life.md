Another photo from another concert I walked to from home.

We were invited to attend a [gala concert for the New Century Chamber Orchestra](https://www.ncco.org/events/2023-gala). I'd gone to a show some time ago, really liked it, wrote about it, and met some of the folks involved through that.

It was our first time attending a high society event in San Francisco. There was wonderful music. The multiple Grammy-winning [San Francisco Girls Chorus](https://www.sfgirlschorus.org) sang a few select pieces, and we were also treated to the 'dark, velvety' operatic voice of [Nikola Printz](http://nikolaprintz.com).

Since the theme of the evening was 'Out of the Woods', there were also fairies. Naturally. I took a photo of one of them here.
