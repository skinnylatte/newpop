Almost 50 years ago, a drag queen named Tessie started feeding the homeless in the Tenderloin and so many decades later the tradition continues. I was grateful to be able to volunteer this past Easter at one of the [Tenderloin Tessie events](http://www.tenderlointessie.com).

Every Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas, the organization puts out a massive event feeding hot food to anyone who needs it. Not everyone who came was homeless, all who wanted a hot meal were welcome. Many immigrant families also came and I think, the opportunity to feed your entire family good food and have fun entertainment is always welcome, regardless of your financial situation.

I was very impressed with the values that the organizers imparted to the volunteers. Treat everyone with respect, seat them at the table, provide table service, make sure that people have what they need and that they go home with things that will help.

The line started on the street, on Geary and Franklin.

There were also free haircuts to be had.

There was also free clothing, very neatly organized by gender and size.

The venue was wonderful and light-filled.

We also handed out gift bags with some essential items.

It's a wonderful initiative. I'm going to keep going back to volunteer when I can.
