I have always loved film photography. I love everything about it.

From the moment I was given a disposable film camera as a child, to collecting old cameras and taking them on my travels, I love the whole process of waiting to see what photos I come back with.

Like so many others, I have been mostly digital for a while. That's fine. I don't much care for the film vs digital debate; but I _love_ film cameras, the older the better.

At the end of 2022, I decided to jump back into film again. I now live somewhere else (San Francisco), have more time and ability to indulge this admittedly expensive and indulgent hobby, and also generally feel like I have more stories I'd like to share.

Before I do that, I'd like to start at the beginning.

17 years ago: this was me in a different place and time. With the same old hobby. Let's see what it all looks like when I pick up where I last left off, shall we?
