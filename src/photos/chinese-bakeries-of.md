When you think of bakeries in San Francisco, perhaps you think of sourdough. Certainly, there are some well known bakeries in the city known for their sourdough, but that's not a style or type of bread I enjoy at all.

I don't think it's for everyone, but I like Chinese and Japanese bakeries. I like soft, pillowy breads that straddle the line between savory and sweet. I like hot dogs in my buns. I like ham in my bread. I like scallions in them, too. Barbecue pork. Eggs. All of it. My palate leans heavily on the savory side of things, and I also prefer my breads that way. Salty. Savory. I opine on that, and more, [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7BRqpyroBQ&t=4s).

As part of my increasing frustration at the perennial sour-ness of bread in the city I now live in, I seek out Chinese bakeries. Here are a few of my favorites.

[Mee Mee bakery](https://goo.gl/maps/hgwP4Wq3j8Tn6CNy7) in Chinatown (pictured), is known for its 'cow ear cookies' or 'pig ear cookies', a savory spiral biscuit that's really more salty than sweet. I love that shit.

I also like [Yummy Bakery](https://goo.gl/maps/6edZvEUcsJAS4pkC8) for Hong Kong style 'paper cup cakes', which are fluffier and softer than American cupcakes; almost like a souffle, but like paper. If that makes sense. Also try their egg white tarts and wife cakes.

In the Outer Mission, [Princess Bakery](https://goo.gl/maps/k9DJMAcMoYmUKi4Q6) is an old school favorite. Try the coconut buns and the hot dog scallion buns. In the same neighborhood, [Hong Kong Bakery](https://goo.gl/maps/yQcFvBsLDoPpL1YZ8) is a classic. Don't sleep on the Excelsior: I think it has the highest density of my favorite Chinese food in the city, more than Chinatown and more than the Sunset or Richmond.

Lastly, [Pineapple King Bakery](https://goo.gl/maps/fSQsaUxc8FqUQvTJ6), like I [recommend in the YouTube show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7BRqpyroBQ&t=4s). Try literally anything there, and definitely don't skip the milk tea. I wish there were more Japanese bakeries in the city, but there are not. I'm glad people enjoy the sourdough of San Francisco, but I'm overjoyed that I have these alternatives here. I'm trying to take the perspective of "it's okay to not like things", but it is so goddamn hard when it's so hard to find good bread in this city that isn't surprisingly sour. (Recently, I bought a bag of bagels, and it was made of sourdough. Without warning. Sour simply isn't a flavor I enjoy: [I also feel that way about American hot sauce](https://hachyderm.io/@skinnylatte/109832248412123015).)
