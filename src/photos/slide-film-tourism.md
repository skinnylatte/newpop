A few firsts: 

* I went to a super touristy part of San Francisco for the first time
* I shot slide film for the first time
* I saw a very old friend from my Dubai days, for the first time in a decade

Boats.

I probably won't go there for another ten years. Other than wanting to spend time with my friend, a place like Fisherman's Wharf simply accelerates my social and Covid-19 anxiety. I also don't like the shops and food there, but I know it's not for me.
