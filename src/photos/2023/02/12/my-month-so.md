A series of unprecedented storms swept us in San Francisco in January and February. Dark clouds and gloomy skies are not your typical fare here. I felt just as gloomy, but also thankful for the rain's impact on California's drought situation.

Soon, the sky started becoming bluer and bluer. Sometimes pink too.

And now we're back to blue, and I'm happy again.
