There's a curious shop on a street I walk past daily, that makes it look like we're in the '60s. It sells vintage magazines and other memorabilia. It also has vintage theatrical programs and erotica.

I thought it would be a nice shot to take photo of a retro magazine store with my retro camera. So here's a shot of [The Magazine](https://themagazinesf.com), taken with my 60 year old camera.
