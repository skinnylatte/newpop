Join me on a walk around Lower Polk, a neighborhood directly adjacent to mine. I spend a lot of time here because it has the grocery stores and other shops that I go to the most. I rarely need to take a bus or car anywhere else because I get everything in the Tenderloin and Lower Polk, as well as in and around Nob Hill.

*A sign of the times.*

*I feel lucky to be able to walk to a world class film photography store, [Glass Key Photo](https://www.glasskeyphoto.com/). They have everything I need, and more.*

*RIP, Harvey Milk. Thanks for everything you have done for this city.*

*Hi-Lo has great drinks. Back when I still imbibed. These days, I just like the neon signs of these bars.*

*Count the rubber duckies.*

*This part of San Francisco has a strong link to Frank Norris, the anti-Semitic author. A bar in Lower Polk is named after one of his novels, McTeague.*

All photos taken on Leica M3, 50mm Summilux, bulkrolled Kentmere Pan 400. Self developed in Ilfosol 3 (1+9) for 7 minutes, and scanned with Plustek 8200i.
