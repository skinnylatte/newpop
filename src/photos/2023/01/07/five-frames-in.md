Beirut's Gemmayzeh is one of the most popular neighborhoods for nightlife. It's full of bars and galleries and when I am in town, I do tend to be there quite regularly. The [Torino Express](https://goo.gl/maps/i9AabLoqRaKHberj8) is one of my favorite cafes in the world. I don't have much opportunity to go there anymore, which saddens me. A lot has changed since I was there last, half a decade ago.
