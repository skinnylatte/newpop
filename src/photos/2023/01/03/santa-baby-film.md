Happy holidays! We're having weather here in San Francisco, which is a bit of an event. My plan for the next couple of weeks is to stay inside. This city is not made for weather, since we so rarely have any.

The best thing that happened to me over Christmas 2022 is that I started shooting film again. 

Funny story: I was so mad at how my last few rolls of film turned out that I stopped using my film cameras for a few years. Turns out I have poor eyesight in my right eye, and I can't really focus rangefinders very well. I'm getting that fixed. So thank you, rangefinder focus, for letting me know to check my eyesight.

Some Santa-related photos from the last couple of weeks. I think this was Kodacolor 200, but I can never remember.
