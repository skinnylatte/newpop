<caption><em>Nikon point and shoot camera has wide and tele lenses, so it’s very handy. Not quite as slim as an Olympus XA, though.</em></caption>

I got a [Nikon L35TWAD](http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Nikon_L35TWAF/L35TWAD/Tele%E2%80%A2Touch) some time ago but was not able to turn it on. Turns out these babies have a rather iffy battery door. I finally fixed it, and have loaded in my first roll of film. I’m excited to see how the photos turn out. 

There are a few versions of the L35 camera, they’re all quite capable. 

[Check out what this camera can do.](https://youtu.be/1dHtd82prxQ) There is a lot more info on YouTube about this camera now than when I first got it. I’m interested in the AWAF weather-sealed version that has a better battery door, but the eBay prices are quite high at the moment.
