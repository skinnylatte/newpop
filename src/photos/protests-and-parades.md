One of the interesting things about living near City Hall is I never know what I'm going to walk into. Some days it's a protest about the declining state of trans rights in this country. Or one by the Burmese or Iranian communities to try to raise awareness of the issues at home. 

Other days it's an Irish festival that somehow has large representation from law enforcement. (For more information about the impact of the Irish in San Francisco law enforcement, read [Season of the Witch](https://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Season-of-the-Witch-by-David-Talbot-review-3536031.php).) I had my [black and white film camera out](https://micro.popagandhi.com/2023/03/20/st-patricks-day.html), but I also had a roll of Kodak Vision 3 500T film in my rangefinder camera that I got processed and scanned much later.

I was interested in the parade and curious to know how it would proceed in the rain; though like many other observers, I kept a distance from it. I [come from a country where protest isn't allowed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/24/singapore-smiley-face-activist-in-one-man-protest-charged-with-unlawful-assembly) (except in a very specific park with strict rules requiring pre-approval), so I am always going to be photographing and gawking at any protests, and parades (which also require pre-approval where I come from), I think, even if I might not agree with all of them.

Tomorrow, I'm going to go to a rally for trans rights. It's cool that I can just stroll over to show my support for things like that.

The entire street was closed.

San Francisco is the hub of the Irish diaspora in the West Coast. The police force has also been a favored profession for that community.

Classic cars are my thing.

Rainy days are here again.

I really like the colors on the motion picture film. This photo would not be as interesting on regular color film!
