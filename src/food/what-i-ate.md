*Sept 22, 2023*

It was my first full day back in Singapore. Here's what I ate, and where.

Excellent scallion pancakes and fried dumplings from [喬記面館](https://maps.app.goo.gl/N6PEhWZB8JBYQBQn7?g_st=ic)

Excellent coffee at [Kurasu](https://maps.google.com?q=261%20Waterloo%20St,%20%2301-24,%20Singapore%20180261&ftid=0x31da19a4fea446b9:0x3796b49b82a2d481&hl=en-US&gl=us&entry=gps&lucs=,47071704&g_st=ic). Today, they had a coffee bean from Yunnan. I had to try that since I’ve never tried Chinese espresso beans before. Very fruity!
