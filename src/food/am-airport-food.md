_Noyah La Maison, Changi Airport T4_

One of the best things about being back in my part of the world, is that breakfast foods now make sense. 

No more pancakes, syrup, waffles, badly made eggs for brunch. Definitely no donuts. No sugar in general for breakfast for me, except a little bit in my kopi. 

6am at Changi Airport was a routine for me for many years. I was typically catching a 7am flight to Indonesia, Thailand or Myanmar a few times a week in the last decade and a half. 

There are lots of kopi spots and while airport franchises aren’t as good as what you’d get in the city proper, it’s still whole lot better than donuts!

Kaya butter toast, kopi, soft boiled eggs are usually sold in a ‘breakfast set’. I was also able to add on halal siew mai. 

It’s going to keep me happy until I land in Surabaya in two or so hours.
