This post was written for friends and friends of friends. It's specifically for someone who has not been to Singapore, doesn't know anything about food in that part of the world, might have heard about the food scene, but doesn't know where to start. My goal here is to try you cut through the cruft and focus on eating as well as you can, with a special emphasis on things that may be harder to get outside of that part of the world. 

I won't claim any of the items here are the 'best' of some category: people who have their personal faves in any category don't need this list.

A few things to note about Singapore food:

- it's a huge food city with good and not so good food at every price range, from the very cheap to the 'as expensive as the best restaurants in the world' category
- there's hyper-local food and there's _glocal_ and global food. it's this combination of cuisines and cultures that I find most interesting about eating in Singapore
- there's more to Singapore food than Chinese food
- chains are mostly good! un-learn the things you've learned from US foodie-ism and embrace Asian restaurant chains

### Hyper-local food

Singapore food has its roots in _many_ cultures, individually as well as together. If you're familiar with Chinese food elsewhere, you'll notice many familiar dishes that are done somewhat differently. 

Wanton noodles? Depends on whether you want KL-style, Singapore Cantonese style, or Sarawak kolo-mee style.

Chicken rice? Thai style, the platonic ideal Singapore style, or Vietnamese style.

Laksa? Katong-style, Johor-style, Sarawak-style, Penang-style?

If you ask me, and not just because I'm Teochew, [Teochew food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teochew_cuisine) is one of the most interesting things about Singapore food. Singapore, along with Bangkok and Hong Kong, is probably the largest Teochew food city _in the world_ (outside of China). This is a cuisine that focuses on good ingredients, a light / deft touch, and there's a bunch of classic Teochew dishes you might have seen in Thai, Vietnamese foods that don't get branded as such, but that definitely came from Teochew cuisine. And in Singapore, you can have many, many types of Teochew foods.

- Bak kut teh: a pork rib soup often eaten for breakfast. Teochew style bak kut teh, the default in Singapore, is made with copious amounts of white pepper and other spices
- Chwee kueh: little steamed rice cakes eaten with a tasy chilli and turnip relish
- Kway chap: braised pork offal
- Kway teow: same as the Thai kuay tiaw, different stles of kway teow here. The most famous being the 'fried' version, or 'char kway teow'
- Tar mee: Teochew noodles with soup on the side, often served with fishballs and / or pork

At the same time, South Indian, especially Tamil foods, is another major food category for me when I think of the uniqueness of food in Singapore. 

Try: 

- Junior Kupanna: 'rustic' Tamil Nadu non-vegetarian foods from the heartlands 
- Murugan Idli: a well known idli chain from South India (vegetarian)
- Kerala style foods: from seafood to biryanis, to steamed rice cakes, we've got lots of Kerala foods here

Peranakan food

Malay food

### Glocal food

As a port city, Singapore has been at a crossroads of ingredients, cooking styles, and cultures for _centuries_. As a result, you'll get Chinese people cooking curries, Indian people making Malay food, hyper-local food (like prawn noodles) prepared with global ingredients, like the iberico ham prawn noodle soup.

### Global food

Here are some cuisines that Singapore does _really well_ in.

- Japanese: far more high quality Japanese restaurants than many other cities outside of Japan
- regional Chinese: where to start? As a friend once described it, 'most exciting Chinese food scene outside of China and Hong Kong'
- Thai: there's excellent Thai food in Little Thailand
- Burmese: there's really good Burmese in Little Burma
- Malaysian: it's hard to tell where the line between Malaysian and Singaporean food starts and ends (and this is something Malaysians feel very patriotically about). Personally, I do think Malaysian foods are better than ours, but I also think that in the last decades, so many of their best food sellers have moved to Singapore anyway so
- French: Singapore has more French people than some French towns (more than 30 000). There are _all sorts of French restaurants_ from Brittany bakeries to Alsatian tarte flambee restaurants to Michelin-starred French restaurants run by locals

If you don't know what to do with this information, you can also just grab the list.
