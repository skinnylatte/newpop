### Got into Instant Film

I got a Polaroid SX-70 and that's unleashed a new passion for Polaroid instant film. I've been shooting instant film with Instax film, but Polraoid is a whole other beast. Far more finicky, but I also enjoy the experience. 

### Spent a month with my family 

My parents came to visit me. We went to Monterey, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle. It was lovely showing them my part of the world. They were already very familiar with San Francisco, but got to see these other cities this time. We traveled by Amtrak, coach (Flixbus), plane (Alaska Air out of Burbank, best way to arrive in / leave Los Angeles), and caught a ride with friends (Monterey to Los Angeles). We ate well, saw waterfalls, saw friends. It was a lovely way to spend a month.

### Continued to commute to Monterey

After 4 months going to and from Monterey (by shuttle), I've grown quite comfortable with the commute and life there. I have favorite spots ([Ho Wah](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3SqK4qe5gYj4RDdi7)! [Barba azul](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JB73g6hg83CvHMNe7)! [First Oriental Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/E1FztRqfaL8oYtbEA)!), friends, and more. I like it.
