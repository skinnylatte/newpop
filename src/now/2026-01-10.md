### Refreshed design

Spent some time changing up this site's look and feel. Can you guess what inspired me? 

### Celebrated the new year cozily

This new year, we were snug and cozy, as we have been for a number of years. Still the best way to ring in the year.

### Catching up with old friends

It's the season for catching up with old friends. This past week, I've spoken to lots of people I've known from a long time ago, from all over the world. Good times. I miss you all.

### Penne Pals

I started doing a pretty fun thing I call Penne Pals. The idea is I want to talk to anyone, anywhere, as long as they're not trying to sell me something. I put up a [cal link](https://app.onecal.io/b/adrianna-tan/penne-pals) and people book time. There are some rules, of course. No agendas, and no MLM / religion / startups. I've probably talked to hundreds of people I don't know this way, and learned so much.

### Started an AI research lab

For the past year, I've been working on AI red teams and evals. It's been rewarding work, and I am so energized by new clarity on some very specific areas of investigation that I'd like to follow. We even have a [website](https://futureethics.ai)! It was great to see all the things I've done in this space, [on one page](https://futureethics.ai/past-work/).
