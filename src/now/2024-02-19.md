### Rebuilding my website

Building this site from the ground up using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). It's fantastic.

### Celebrating Lunar New Year

Desired the pineapple tarts I would have from home. Could not procure them here. Got into making them from scratch. From whole pineapples. I wrote up my [pineapple saga](https://buttondown.email/skinnylatte/archive/a-pineapple-saga/).

### Learning to swim

Taking swim classes at the YMCA here in SF.

### Learning to develop Slide Film

Eagerly awaiting some E-6 film chemicals so that I can develop some slide film that I've been hoarding.

### Learning Taiwanese

Taking weekly Taigi (Hokkien, not Mandarin) classes with an [online teacher](https://italki.com) based in Kaohsiung.

### Learning Typography

[Weekend classes at Berkeley extension](https://extension.berkeley.edu/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&courseId=40710) to learn to design, critique and talk about typography.
