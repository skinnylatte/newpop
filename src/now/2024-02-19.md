### Rebuilding my website

Building this site from the ground up using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). It's fantastic.

### Learning to swim

Taking swim classes at the YMCA here in SF.

### Learning to develop Slide Film

Eagerly awaiting some E-6 film chemicals so that I can develop some slide film that I've been hoarding.

### Learning Taiwanese

Taking weekly Taigi (Hokkien, not Mandarin) classes with an online teacher based in Kaohsiung.

### Learning Typography

Weekend classes at Berkeley extension to learn to design, critique and talk about typefaces.
