In a world that feels like it is coming undone, I find a lot of solace in making things with my hands. The biggest breakthrough I developed was when I decided I don't need to be good at everything that I do. I can just.. _do things_. 

That goes against my programming as a competitive over-achiever, but it was ultimately what gave me the mindset I needed to.. _do the things I need to feel less shitty_ about the world.

Things I did: 

- Attended an intro to pottery class
- Started a doodle notebook
- Picked up a water brush and a palette of colors
- Learned how to develop film (black and white, and color) at home
- Learned how to print film negatives of various sizes in a darkroom (black and white, as well as color)
- Fold origami
- Code this website entirely by hand

Some things stuck more than others. I'd like to learn bookbinding, as well as to go deeper into pottery. Like I love saying: my hobby is having hobbies. I don't want or need to ever _hustle with my hobbies_.

I think I am just done with hustle, full stop. I enjoy making and building things, whether it is software, or a thingamajig. That is enough for me.
