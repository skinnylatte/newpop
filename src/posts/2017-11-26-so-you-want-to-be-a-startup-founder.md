I was asked to speak at a local university's Young Entrepreneur Network event. Sometimes, I say yes to these things.

For anyone interested, here are the slides.

I wanted to share, mostly, my personal journey â€” how I got here. I also wanted to share some strategies for thinking about creating a startup if you're starting from the absolute beginning, like I was.

Click through to see the notes, which contain slightly more info than what's on the deck.

Happy to receive any feedback or answer any questions. Email address on the last slide.
