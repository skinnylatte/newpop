[_This was published in QLRS in Jan 2003_](http://www.qlrs.com/poem.asp?id=269).

I had weighed the burden of desire in my hands

but in yours you weighed reality between your fingers,

half serious even as we tried to kid ourselves

(and others) nothing else quite mattered.

I weigh now the desire of burden in my fingers

but in yours you now weigh illusion between your hands,

half kidding even as we deal with truth

ours as much as othersâ€™; nothing else but this matters now.
