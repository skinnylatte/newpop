I've been busy. Over the weekend, I launched:

- [Public Sector AI](https://publicsectorai.tech/)
- and its [accompanying newsletter](https://news.publicsectorai.tech/)

The motivation for doing so is, I am noticing an increasing amount of [YOLO](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/yolo) and [FOMO](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/fomo?q=FOMO) with regards to artificial intelligence. Government is at once trying to regulate, as well as to determine how to engage. 

I'm hoping my perspectives as the director of product management at San Francisco Digital Services, the digital arm of the City and County of San Francisco, as well as my personal interest in the ethics of and latest developments in artificial intelligence, can help my fellow public servants around the world [make sense of what's happening and how we can meet the moment](https://publicsectorai.tech/posts/welcome/). Or not.

Especially if your boss says, _we need to use AI_! Here are some [questions to ask](https://publicsectorai.tech/posts/questions-to-ask/); [here's what other people are doing](https://publicsectorai.tech/posts/what-is-ai/), and what you need to know.

For now, I'm envisioning the site to be a resource on 'what you can do' / 'how you can think about' AI' and for the newsletter to be on 'state of AI / public sector' (there's a lot of news about AI now, and a lot of hype. Which ones are relevant to you).

[Let me know](/contact) if you have any thoughts, questions, feedback.
