A few things happened.

The main one being, my soulmate, my soul, the love of my life, Cookie pie, passed away. I am bereft, but not afloat.

It feels like a brand new chapter in my life.

Cookie, born 1 October 2009 in Petaling Jaya, died 20 June 2024 in San Francisco. 

She was deeply loved through all 14 years and 8 months of her life. There was not a moment where she was not surrounded by tremendous love, warmth and care. She passed, surrounded by people who love her. She was snacking on treats until the end.

Because of her, I learned to love my new home in San Francisco: fog, rain, cold and all. We went everywhere together. We saw everything. We ate: all the time.

I have a [thread on Mastodon with more photos and stories](https://hachyderm.io/@skinnylatte/112293528048638569) about our life together. While I miss her a lot, I am also looking forward to learning more about how to exist without her. She was such a big part of my life that I'm afraid she was almost central to my identity for almost fifteen years.
