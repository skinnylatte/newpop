title: "Past Forward: A Heritage Blogging and Social Media Workshop"
---

My friend [Yu-Mei](http://blog.toomanythoughts.org/) is putting together a blogging and social media workshop as part of [HeritageFest](http://www.heritagefest.sg/en/), a NHB event.

I'll be speaking with Rosenah Omar at 3pm, on a panel moderated by [Notabilia](http://notabilia.wordpress.com/), although I do wish I could split myself and attend the panel on 1960s music at the same time! Here's the schedule for the day, and here's the [Facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/243987645704984/). Hope to see you there!
