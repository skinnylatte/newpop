title: Gyanada 2014

As you may know, I set up The Gyanada Foundation last year. We've spent the past year building the organisation and learning as much as we can.

Last year, we supported 150 girls in India. This year we hope to raise that number to 350, including the existing students we have onboard currently; also expanding geographical reach alongside enrolment numbers at the same time.

Yesterday evening we had a great event at Artistry where we talked about what we've done so far and what we hope to accomplish in the near future. 

Here's some information about [what we do]("http://gyanada.org).
