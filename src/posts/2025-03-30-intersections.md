For an all hands meeting [at work](/now/2025-01-19/), I was asked if I wanted to share a story about my life and how I got here.

It has not been the easiest, holding all of these identities and selves, often in places that did not welcome me. I think sometimes of [Merantau](/posts/merantau-cino/): of finding a home away from home. All of my parts and intersections make up the messy and glorious bits that I have lived and experienced.

I turn forty this year. I want so much to tell the four year old self: it's going to be fine, you're going to have fun, one day you are going to put up beautiful photos of your life and tell your story to everyone.
